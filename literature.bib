 abstract = {The paper presents an approach where traditional Power Transfer Distribution Factors (PTDF) matrix is reduced in size so that it reflects sensitivities of branch flows to changes in nodal power injections at generator buses only. The advantage of the reduced PTDF matrix is in both reductions of decision variables in the optimization procedure and number of columns in branch flow constraints matrix. Furthermore, the number of rows is also reduced on the basis of a simple check, which effectively detects non-binding branch flow limits allowing corresponding rows of the matrix to be omitted. The reduced PTDF matrix was successfully applied in solving two direct current optimal power flow problems: cost minimization and total transfer capacity calculation.},

 abstract = {Congestion management is one of the technical challenges in the power system. Privatization and market liberalization lead to stressed operating conditions in existing and future power systems. Additionally, the increasing complexity of the power system results in an increased need for information on the actual grid condition and intelligent control methods. Unfortunately, measurement data from each node is not in the distribution level. Introduction of decentralized control methods allows overcoming the limitations associated with centralized control, like failure of main controller. In this paper, a concept of congestion management using a multi-agent system is presented. In this approach, control processes are realized by active power adjustments based on Power Transfer Distribution Factor methodology. Depending on localization of congested line, appropriate agent initiates the whole redispatch procedure.},

@article{Uribarri.2017,
 abstract = {Many papers have been written over the last years addressing the potential of decentralized solar thermal systems addressing the potential of decentralized solar thermal systems in District Heating Network (DHN), assuming that the network can be used as a virtual storage so that prosumers can release excess solar energy into the network and use it later when it is needed.

When looking at the district heating systems in detail, many questions still remain unanswered. Is it possible to feed in all the surplus solar energy into the net? How does the solar input affect the network and the other prosumers? Is it sensible from the energy balance perspective? We have studied an existing DHN in an attempt to answer these questions.

A simulation model of the DHN in the Southern German city quarter Ludwigsburg-Sonnenberg was developed and extended to include decentralized feed-in of heat from solar thermal collectors to evaluate their potential contribution to network demands.

It could be shown that prosumers supply during summer period significantly more heat than they demand, so that the thermal network could operate as an autonomous micro-grid.

By comparing the amount of electrical pumping energy that is needed to feed heat to the DHN with usable solar thermal energy, the benefit ration of feeding heat into the DHN can quantified.},

@article{vanderHeijde.2017,
 abstract = {Simulation and optimisation of district heating and cooling networks requires efficient and realistic models of the individual network elements in order to correctly represent heat losses or gains, temperature propagation and pressure drops. Due to more recent thermal networks incorporating meshing decentralised heat and cold sources, the system often has to deal with variable temperatures and mass flow rates, with flow reversal occurring more frequently. This paper presents the mathematical derivation and software implementation in Modelica of a thermo-hydraulic model for thermal networks that meets the above requirements and compares it to both experimental data and a commonly used model. Good correspondence between experimental data from a controlled test set-up and simulations using the presented model was found. Compared to measurement data from a real district heating network, the simulation results led to a larger error than in the controlled test set-up, but the general trend is still approximated closely and the model yields results similar to a pipe model from the Modelica Standard Library. However, the presented model simulates 1.7 (for low number of volumes) to 68 (for highly discretized pipes) times faster than a conventional model for a realistic test case. A working implementation of the presented model is made openly available within the IBPSA Modelica Library. The model is robust in the sense that grid size and time step do not need to be adapted to the flow rate, as is the case in finite volume models.},

@article{vanderHeijde.2017b,
 abstract = {Optimal design and operation of district heating networks require accurate, but simple models to allow fast simulation. This paper describes the analytical derivation of such a model based on existing work regarding heat loss and dynamic temperature profile calculations in literature. The most important addition from this work is the incorporation and investigation of heat transfer from supply to return side in double pipes, something which is often (over)simplified in more commonly used models.

The paper presents the mathematical derivations and the assumptions made in detail for the case of steady-state heat losses in double pipes. The resulting model is carefully examined in a parameter study, from which a number of interesting conclusions can be drawn. Firstly, the heat losses are found to be nearly independent of the mass flow rate in the range of mass flow rates usually encountered in thermal network pipes. The remaining heat loss calculation is simply based on temperature levels and thermal resistance factors, determined by the pipe dimensions and materials. Furthermore, it is found that heat losses from supply to return side should be incorporated in the analysis for better accuracy of the results, even more so with the increasing popularity of twin pipes with common insulation.},

 abstract = {Electric power industries throughout the world have been restructured to introduce competition among the market participants and bring several competitive opportunities. A fair competition needs open access and non-discriminatory operation of the transmission network. Open access to the transmission system places an emphasis on the intensive use of the interconnected network reliably, which requires knowledge of the network capability. Available Transfer Capability (ATC) is a measure of the remaining power transfer capability of the transmission network for further transactions. This paper describes the assessment of ATC using AC Power transfer distribution factors (ACPTDFs) in combined economic emission dispatch (CEED) environment. The ACPTDFs are derived using sensitivity based approach for the system intact case and utilized to check the line flow limits during ATC determination. The obtained ATC results are compared with Newton Raphson Load Flow method (NRLF) to justify its accuracy. Simultaneous bilateral and multilateral wheeling transactions have been carried out on IEEE 6, 30 and 118 bus systems for the assessment of ATC. The solutions obtained are quite encouraging and useful in the present restructuring environment.},

Known mixed integer binary formulations for these constraints have a number of binary variables and extra constraints linear in the number of polyhedra. We give sufficient conditions for constructing formulations for these constraints with a number of binary variables and extra constraints logarithmic in the number of polyhedra. Using these conditions we introduce mixed integer binary formulations for SOS1 and SOS2 constraints that have a number of binary variables and extra constraints logarithmic in the number of continuous variables. We also introduce the first mixed integer binary formulations for piecewise linear functions of one and two variables that use a number of binary variables and extra constraints logarithmic in the number of linear pieces of the functions. We prove that the new formulations for piecewise linear functions have favorable tightness properties and present computational results showing that they can significantly outperform other mixed integer binary formulations.},
